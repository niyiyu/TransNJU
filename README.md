# TransNJU

Transparent Nanjing University is an experimental project exploring the fine geological structure underneath Nanjing University Xianlin Campus. Being initialized in May 2020, the project is currently stepping into data procoessing. One of the most essential ingredients of active seismic data processing in this project is Full Waveform Inversion (FWI). This repository contains temporal parameters and configurations of [SeisFlows](https://github.com/niyiyu2316/seisflows) and [SPECFEM 3D](https://github.com/geodynamics/specfem3d) for this local 3D FWI task.
